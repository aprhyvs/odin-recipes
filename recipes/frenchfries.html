    <h2>Description Heading</h2>

    <p>Learn how to make French fries that are 
        super crispy with this twice-fried method.</p>

    <p>The first frying is done at a lower temperature, 
        which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface 
        for the second frying's crispification.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying, about 2 cups or as needed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). 
                Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, 
                stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. 
                Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. 
                Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
         </ol>
